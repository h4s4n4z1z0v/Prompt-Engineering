<p><strong>“Zero Trust Architecture Planning”</strong>, designed for security architects, CISOs, and network engineers using <strong>Generative AI</strong> to model, document, and assess components of a <strong>Zero Trust Architecture (ZTA)</strong>. These prompts are aligned with guidance from <strong>NIST SP 800-207</strong>, and are tailored for both enterprise and hybrid cloud environments.</p><p><br></p><p>1. “Generate a high-level Zero Trust Architecture model for a mid-sized organization using identity, network, and workload segmentation.”</p><p><br></p><p>2. “Create a Zero Trust adoption roadmap broken into phases: visibility, identity enforcement, network segmentation, and policy automation.”</p><p><br></p><p>3. “Write a business case for Zero Trust implementation, including expected benefits, investment priorities, and risk reduction metrics.”</p><p><br></p><p>4. “Draft a policy that enforces least privilege access and micro-segmentation in a Zero Trust environment.”</p><p><br></p><p>5. “Generate a control matrix mapping Zero Trust principles to NIST SP 800-207 components such as policy engine, policy administrator, and enforcement points.”</p><p><br></p><p>6. “Simulate a Zero Trust access scenario where a remote employee requests access to a financial system under dynamic risk evaluation.”</p><p><br></p><p>7. “Write a technical design brief for integrating identity-based access control into Zero Trust using SSO, MFA, and JIT access.”</p><p><br></p><p>8. “Generate a prompt to assess readiness for Zero Trust, identifying current gaps in device posture validation and continuous monitoring.”</p><p><br></p><p>9. “Develop a Zero Trust policy framework for hybrid cloud access that includes workload identities and real-time threat scoring.”</p><p><br></p><p>10. “Write a SOC workflow that responds to Zero Trust violations, such as lateral movement attempts or failed trust evaluation.”</p><p><br></p><p>11. “Create a ZTA implementation checklist for enforcing user-to-app segmentation in a virtual desktop infrastructure (VDI) environment.”</p><p><br></p><p>12. “Design a Zero Trust network strategy that replaces VPN-based remote access with continuous authentication and telemetry checks.”</p><p><br></p><p>13. “Generate a plan to replace perimeter-based security controls with policy-based access enforcement across all endpoints.”</p><p><br></p><p>14. “Simulate a breach scenario and show how Zero Trust policy enforcement limits blast radius and prevents data exfiltration.”</p><p><br></p><p>15. “Write a CISO briefing on implementing Zero Trust with identity-first security, network segmentation, and endpoint health checks.”</p><p><br></p><p>16. “Create a data flow diagram for Zero Trust enforcement across SaaS, PaaS, and on-premise applications.”</p><p><br></p><p>17. “Develop a step-by-step guide to implement policy enforcement points (PEPs) in Zero Trust for email, storage, and apps.”</p><p><br></p><p>18. “Write a risk assessment summary for legacy systems in the context of Zero Trust policy enforcement.”</p><p><br></p><p>19. “Generate a communication plan for IT and business stakeholders to support the Zero Trust transition journey.”</p><p><br></p><p>20. “Create a comparison table of Zero Trust vendors (e.g., Zscaler, Palo Alto, Cisco, Microsoft) and their ZTA capabilities.”</p><p><br></p>
