<p><strong>“Red Team Prompt Design”</strong>, focused on helping cybersecurity professionals leverage <strong>Generative AI</strong> to simulate offensive tactics, craft realistic adversarial scenarios, and automate red team planning—all while staying within ethical boundaries. These prompts are ideal for designing social engineering lures, offensive simulations, and training environments that reflect real-world threats.</p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p>1. “Design a red team simulation that begins with a phishing email containing a malicious Excel macro and ends in domain escalation.”</p><p><br></p><p>2. “Generate a social engineering script for a red teamer impersonating IT support requesting VPN re-authentication.”</p><p><br></p><p>3. “Write a realistic phishing email targeting finance staff using a spoofed invoice theme and a malicious download link.”</p><p><br></p><p>4. “Create a payload-free command line simulation for privilege escalation using ‘runas’ and Windows token manipulation.”</p><p><br></p><p>5. “Generate a red team scenario that leverages Active Directory enumeration to identify lateral movement paths.”</p><p><br></p><p>6. “Design a simulation exercise that includes USB drop attacks with staged payloads for user awareness testing.”</p><p><br></p><p>7. “Create an email-based red team lure using fake MFA alert language and urgency-driven call to action.”</p><p><br></p><p>8. “Generate an offensive scenario where the red team exfiltrates mock data via DNS tunneling without triggering detection rules.”</p><p><br></p><p>9. “Write a prompt to simulate scheduled task abuse for persistence as part of a post-exploitation phase.”</p><p><br></p><p>10. “Design a red team campaign that targets hybrid work environments with VPN-based attack vectors.”</p><p><br></p><p>11. “Produce a phishing simulation involving fake HR policy updates with embedded links to credential-harvesting pages.”</p><p><br></p><p>12. “Generate a Powershell-based simulation script for DLL sideloading within a trusted application folder.”</p><p><br></p><p>13. “Create a series of prompts to simulate email thread hijacking as seen in modern BEC attacks.”</p><p><br></p><p>14. “Develop a red team scenario based on USB keystroke injection using tools like Rubber Ducky or Flipper Zero.”</p><p><br></p><p>15. “Simulate a watering hole attack scenario by crafting a fake blog post with embedded drive-by download scripts.”</p><p><br></p><p>16. “Design a red team narrative targeting DevOps teams via exposed CI/CD tokens or GitHub secrets.”</p><p><br></p><p>17. “Generate a phishing campaign template targeting customer service teams with fake escalation requests.”</p><p><br></p><p>18. “Write a prompt to simulate command and control (C2) beaconing patterns over HTTPS for testing network detection.”</p><p><br></p><p>19. “Create a red team plan that includes Kerberoasting and pass-the-ticket techniques within a lab environment.”</p><p><br></p><p>20. “Draft a simulation exercise based on abusing cloud misconfigurations such as unrestricted S3 buckets and overprivileged roles.”</p>
