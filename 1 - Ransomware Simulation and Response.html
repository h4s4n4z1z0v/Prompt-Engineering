<p><strong>“Ransomware Simulation and Response”</strong>, designed for incident response teams, SOC analysts, red-blue teams, and tabletop facilitators using <strong>Generative AI</strong> to simulate ransomware attacks, develop playbooks, test controls, and train teams in coordinated response.</p><p><br></p><p>1. “Simulate a ransomware infection chain beginning with phishing, followed by privilege escalation and mass encryption of mapped drives.”</p><p><br></p><p>2. “Generate a ransomware tabletop exercise where IT, Legal, PR, and Security teams must collaborate to manage business continuity and external disclosures.”</p><p><br></p><p>3. “Write a step-by-step response plan for detecting and isolating ransomware spread in a flat network environment.”</p><p><br></p><p>4. “Create a ransomware playbook covering initial detection, endpoint triage, forensic imaging, and containment.”</p><p><br></p><p>5. “Simulate a ransomware attack on a hybrid cloud environment, affecting both local file servers and cloud storage.”</p><p><br></p><p>6. “Generate a training scenario where ransomware evades EDR using signed binaries and targets offline backups.”</p><p><br></p><p>7. “Write a red team inject to simulate ransomware that includes ransom note delivery, encryption behavior, and file extension changes.”</p><p><br></p><p>8. “Create a blue team response timeline highlighting key logs, alerts, and actions across the first 6 hours of a ransomware outbreak.”</p><p><br></p><p>9. “Generate a legal and compliance response checklist for ransomware attacks affecting customer data and triggering breach notification laws.”</p><p><br></p><p>10. “Write a ransom negotiation simulation where executive stakeholders must decide whether to pay or engage law enforcement.”</p><p><br></p><p>11. “Create a ransomware risk scoring prompt based on RTO/RPO impact, asset criticality, and lateral spread velocity.”</p><p><br></p><p>12. “Simulate a SOC alert sequence that starts with suspicious PowerShell execution and escalates to ransomware encryption detection.”</p><p><br></p><p>13. “Generate a ransomware debrief template summarizing entry vector, encryption path, logs collected, and response actions.”</p><p><br></p><p>14. “Write a purple team drill scenario where the red team emulates Ryuk and the blue team tunes detections mid-simulation.”</p><p><br></p><p>15. “Create a report template capturing ransomware IOC artifacts such as mutex names, file hashes, ransom notes, and dropped executables.”</p><p><br></p><p>16. “Write a GenAI prompt to simulate encrypted file volume growth and help predict total impact within the first hour of detection.”</p><p><br></p><p>17. “Generate a post-incident forensic narrative aligning ransomware artifacts with MITRE ATT&amp;CK techniques (TA0040, TA0005, TA0011).”</p><p><br></p><p>18. “Simulate a ransomware attack where recovery is delayed due to untested backups and access issues during incident response.”</p><p><br></p><p>19. “Create an internal awareness brief highlighting lessons learned from a simulated ransomware event targeting shared drives.”</p><p><br></p><p>20. “Write a business impact report modeling downtime, recovery cost, and reputation damage from a multi-system ransomware infection.”</p>
