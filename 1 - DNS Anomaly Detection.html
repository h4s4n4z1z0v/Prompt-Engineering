<p><strong>“DNS Anomaly Detection”</strong>, tailored for SOC analysts, network defenders, and detection engineers using <strong>Generative AI</strong> to monitor, investigate, and generate detection logic around <strong>Domain Name System (DNS) misuse</strong>, including tunneling, C2 communication, and beaconing behaviors.</p><p><br></p><p>1. “Analyze this DNS query log and generate a summary of domains exhibiting high entropy indicative of DNS tunneling.”</p><p><br></p><p>2. “Create a detection rule to flag repetitive TXT record lookups from a single endpoint over a short period.”</p><p><br></p><p>3. “Write a summary of beaconing behavior seen in DNS logs, including regular query intervals and dynamic subdomain usage.”</p><p><br></p><p>4. “Simulate a scenario where a compromised host uses DNS A records for covert data exfiltration.”</p><p><br></p><p>5. “Generate a detection alert for DNS requests using unusually long or base64-encoded subdomain strings.”</p><p><br></p><p>6. “Write a SIEM correlation rule to identify outbound DNS traffic patterns linked to known C2 domains.”</p><p><br></p><p>7. “Summarize anomalies in DNS traffic volume per host compared to baselined behavior and working hours.”</p><p><br></p><p>8. “Generate a prompt for identifying DNS queries to dynamic DGA (domain generation algorithm)-based domains.”</p><p><br></p><p>9. “Simulate a threat scenario where malware avoids detection by using DNS over HTTPS (DoH) for callback communications.”</p><p><br></p><p>10. “Create a detection playbook that monitors failed DNS lookups for newly registered domains.”</p><p><br></p><p>11. “Generate an alert when a non-DNS server IP address suddenly starts resolving external domains.”</p><p><br></p><p>12. “Summarize potential exfiltration attempts through successive DNS TXT record usage.”</p><p><br></p><p>13. “Write a SOC playbook entry for investigating DNS anomalies from cloud-hosted endpoints.”</p><p><br></p><p>14. “Create a network heat map visualization prompt that plots frequency of DNS queries by TLD (e.g., .xyz, .tk, .info).”</p><p><br></p><p>15. “Generate a prompt to identify DNS queries with high variance in domain names queried by a single host.”</p><p><br></p><p>16. “Write a detection rule for burst DNS activity followed by periods of silence, a pattern often linked to malware beacons.”</p><p><br></p><p>17. “Simulate DNS log analysis that reveals non-existent domain (NXDOMAIN) responses from known C2 infrastructure.”</p><p><br></p><p>18. “Draft a DNS anomaly report for outbound queries to parked or sinkholed domains by internal workstations.”</p><p><br></p><p>19. “Generate a forensic summary of DNS anomalies observed before, during, and after a known data breach event.”</p><p><br></p><p>20. “Create an automated GenAI prompt for detecting suspicious domains queried shortly after phishing email delivery.”</p>
