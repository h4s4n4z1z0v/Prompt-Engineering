🕵️‍♂️ DNS Anomaly Detection
Tailored for SOC analysts, network defenders, and detection engineers using Generative AI to monitor, investigate, and generate detection logic around Domain Name System (DNS) misuse, including tunneling, C2 communication, and beaconing behaviors.

🕵️‍♂️ Prompt Examples:
🕵️‍♂️ Analyze this DNS query log and generate a summary of domains exhibiting high entropy indicative of DNS tunneling.

🕵️‍♂️ Create a detection rule to flag repetitive TXT record lookups from a single endpoint over a short period.

🕵️‍♂️ Write a summary of beaconing behavior seen in DNS logs, including regular query intervals and dynamic subdomain usage.

🕵️‍♂️ Simulate a scenario where a compromised host uses DNS A records for covert data exfiltration.

🕵️‍♂️ Generate a detection alert for DNS requests using unusually long or base64-encoded subdomain strings.

🕵️‍♂️ Write a SIEM correlation rule to identify outbound DNS traffic patterns linked to known C2 domains.

🕵️‍♂️ Summarize anomalies in DNS traffic volume per host compared to baselined behavior and working hours.

🕵️‍♂️ Generate a prompt for identifying DNS queries to dynamic DGA (domain generation algorithm)-based domains.

🕵️‍♂️ Simulate a threat scenario where malware avoids detection by using DNS over HTTPS (DoH) for callback communications.

🕵️‍♂️ Create a detection playbook that monitors failed DNS lookups for newly registered domains.

🕵️‍♂️ Generate an alert when a non-DNS server IP address suddenly starts resolving external domains.

🕵️‍♂️ Summarize potential exfiltration attempts through successive DNS TXT record usage.

🕵️‍♂️ Write a SOC playbook entry for investigating DNS anomalies from cloud-hosted endpoints.

🕵️‍♂️ Create a network heat map visualization prompt that plots frequency of DNS queries by TLD (e.g., .xyz, .tk, .info).

🕵️‍♂️ Generate a prompt to identify DNS queries with high variance in domain names queried by a single host.

🕵️‍♂️ Write a detection rule for burst DNS activity followed by periods of silence, a pattern often linked to malware beacons.

🕵️‍♂️ Simulate DNS log analysis that reveals non-existent domain (NXDOMAIN) responses from known C2 infrastructure.

🕵️‍♂️ Draft a DNS anomaly report for outbound queries to parked or sinkholed domains by internal workstations.

🕵️‍♂️ Generate a forensic summary of DNS anomalies observed before, during, and after a known data breach event.

🕵️‍♂️ Create an automated GenAI prompt for detecting suspicious domains queried shortly after phishing email delivery.
