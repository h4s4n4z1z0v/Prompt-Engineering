<p><strong>“Vulnerability Scanning and Prioritization”</strong>, crafted for cybersecurity experts using <strong>Generative AI</strong> to interpret scan results, assess vulnerability impact, automate prioritization, and generate remediation guidance based on <strong>CVSS scores</strong>, <strong>asset criticality</strong>, and <strong>exploitability trends</strong>.</p><p><br></p><p>1. “Summarize the results of this vulnerability scan and group findings by severity level using CVSS base scores.”</p><p><br></p><p>2. “Based on this scan output, identify the top 5 critical vulnerabilities and explain the risk to business operations.”</p><p><br></p><p>3. “Generate a prioritized remediation list for these vulnerabilities considering asset criticality, exposure level, and known exploits.”</p><p><br></p><p>4. “Given this list of CVEs, classify each one as exploitable remotely, locally, or requiring user interaction, and prioritize accordingly.”</p><p><br></p><p>5. “Analyze this scan report and identify vulnerabilities with active Metasploit or CISA KEV entries.”</p><p><br></p><p>6. “Create an executive summary of vulnerability risks for leadership, including affected systems and recommended timelines.”</p><p><br></p><p>7. “Explain why CVE-2023-23397 is high priority in an enterprise environment and what makes it exploitable at scale.”</p><p><br></p><p>8. “Compare two scan reports from consecutive months and highlight newly discovered high-impact vulnerabilities.”</p><p><br></p><p>9. “Based on the following findings, which vulnerabilities qualify as high-risk under the NIST Cybersecurity Framework?”</p><p><br></p><p>10. “Generate patching recommendations for all critical CVEs identified in this Qualys/Nessus scan.”</p><p><br></p><p>11. “Write a business-friendly summary of unresolved vulnerabilities in the CRM environment and their potential financial impact.”</p><p><br></p><p>12. “Correlate these CVEs with MITRE ATT&amp;CK techniques to understand potential exploitation paths.”</p><p><br></p><p>13. “Prioritize these vulnerabilities by combining CVSS scores with threat intelligence feeds indicating active exploitation.”</p><p><br></p><p>14. “Review this scan from a healthcare IT environment and flag vulnerabilities that could impact HIPAA compliance.”</p><p><br></p><p>15. “Identify legacy systems most exposed by this vulnerability scan and suggest compensating controls if patching is delayed.”</p><p><br></p><p>16. “Create a table summarizing each vulnerability’s exploitability, asset criticality, patch availability, and suggested deadline.”</p><p><br></p><p>17. “Generate a scriptable checklist of tasks to remediate the top 3 vulnerabilities from this scan using Windows Group Policy.”</p><p><br></p><p>18. “Summarize third-party application vulnerabilities on user workstations and recommend patching cadence.”</p><p><br></p><p>19. “Analyze the risks posed by out-of-date TLS configurations and weak cipher suites found in this scan.”</p><p><br></p><p>20. “Identify vulnerabilities in this containerized environment and prioritize fixes based on workload sensitivity and external exposure.”</p>
