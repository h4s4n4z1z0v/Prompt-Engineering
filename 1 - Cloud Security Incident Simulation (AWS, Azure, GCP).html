🌐 Cloud Security Incident Simulation Scenarios
🔹 1. Simulate an AWS security incident involving a leaked IAM user access key used to exfiltrate S3 data.
🔹 2. Generate an incident response scenario for an Azure storage account misconfiguration exposing PII to the public internet.
🔹 3. Create a GCP-based incident simulation involving a compromised service account with unrestricted API access.
🔹 4. Write a multi-cloud attack simulation where a threat actor pivots from an Azure VM into AWS using shared credentials.
🔹 5. Simulate an incident where EC2 instances with unpatched AMIs are exploited for crypto mining.
🔹 6. Generate a scenario involving a GCP bucket lacking proper access controls, indexed and accessed by unauthorized users.
🔹 7. Create a cloud incident narrative about elevated permissions being granted in Azure Active Directory without approval.
🔹 8. Write an alert simulation for detecting lateral movement between cloud workloads using VPC peering in AWS.
🔹 9. Simulate a cloud-native phishing campaign targeting Azure AD login portals, leading to credential compromise.
🔹 10. Generate a step-by-step response scenario for unauthorized CloudTrail disablement in AWS.
🔹 11. Create an incident drill where AWS Lambda functions are abused to exfiltrate data disguised as normal business processes.
🔹 12. Simulate the compromise of a GCP Cloud Function used for processing customer support emails via privilege escalation.
🔹 13. Write a prompt to test detection of brute-force login attempts to Azure-hosted applications protected by conditional access.
🔹 14. Generate a red team simulation for chaining IAM roles to escalate privileges in a serverless AWS app.
🔹 15. Develop a training scenario where SOC analysts respond to unauthorized Google Workspace OAuth integrations.
🔹 16. Simulate a misconfigured AWS Security Group that allows open RDP access and threat actor exploitation.
🔹 17. Create a cloud security incident response report for lateral movement within an Azure Kubernetes cluster.
🔹 18. Write a multi-stage attack scenario targeting GCP IAM bindings and suppression of cloud audit logs.
🔹 19. Generate a timeline of events for a data breach caused by a GCP API key leak posted on a public GitHub repository.
🔹 20. Design an incident response drill where Azure Sentinel detects an unusual spike in data egress from an Azure SQL instance.
