<p><strong>“SIEM Rule Suggestions Based on Logs”</strong>, designed for SOC analysts, threat detection engineers, and SIEM administrators using <strong>Generative AI</strong> to review log patterns, propose detection rules, optimize alert logic, and build content that aligns with attack techniques (e.g., MITRE ATT&amp;CK).</p><p><br></p><p>1. “Analyze this authentication log data and suggest a SIEM rule to detect brute-force login attempts over RDP.”</p><p><br></p><p>2. “Review PowerShell execution logs and generate a detection rule for encoded or obfuscated command-line activity.”</p><p><br></p><p>3. “Based on these firewall logs, suggest a correlation rule to detect repeated access attempts from blocked geolocations.”</p><p><br></p><p>4. “Write a SIEM rule for detecting lateral movement using remote service creation across multiple endpoints.”</p><p><br></p><p>5. “Generate a use case rule to detect excessive file downloads from a corporate file share during non-business hours.”</p><p><br></p><p>6. “Suggest a detection rule based on DNS logs to identify potential DNS tunneling attempts using long TXT queries.”</p><p><br></p><p>7. “Analyze endpoint logs and create a SIEM rule to flag the execution of known living-off-the-land binaries (LOLBins).”</p><p><br></p><p>8. “Write a correlation rule to detect privilege escalation by chaining audit logs showing token manipulation and local admin access.”</p><p><br></p><p>9. “Based on VPN connection logs, generate a rule to alert on impossible travel or simultaneous logins from different countries.”</p><p><br></p><p>10. “Create a SIEM alert rule that triggers when Windows Event ID 4624 is followed by 4672 (special privileges assigned) within 1 minute.”</p><p><br></p><p>11. “Suggest a detection rule to identify Kerberoasting attempts using high-frequency ticket requests for service accounts.”</p><p><br></p><p>12. “Generate a rule for identifying anomalous PowerShell use based on command length, character entropy, and frequency.”</p><p><br></p><p>13. “Analyze cloud audit logs and suggest a SIEM rule for detecting suspicious permission changes in Azure AD or AWS IAM.”</p><p><br></p><p>14. “Write a rule to detect Beacon-like outbound traffic to external IPs based on periodic network patterns.”</p><p><br></p><p>15. “Create a SIEM rule to correlate successful login followed by data transfer over FTP from the same host within 5 minutes.”</p><p><br></p><p>16. “Generate a Splunk search query that identifies failed sudo attempts across multiple Linux servers in a short time window.”</p><p><br></p><p>17. “Design a rule to detect macro execution in Office apps that launches child processes like cmd.exe or powershell.exe.”</p><p><br></p><p>18. “Write a detection rule to alert on unsigned binaries executing from temporary or user-writable directories.”</p><p><br></p><p>19. “Suggest a correlation rule that links suspicious registry modifications with subsequent endpoint communication to known C2 domains.”</p><p><br></p><p>20. “Based on EDR logs, generate a rule to detect execution of remote scripts using WinRM from non-jump-box hosts.”</p><p><br></p>
