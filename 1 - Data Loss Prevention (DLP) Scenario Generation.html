## 🛡️ Data Loss Prevention (DLP) Scenario Generation

Tailored for cybersecurity experts, compliance leads, and SOC engineers using **Generative AI** to design realistic **DLP use cases, detection scenarios, incident simulations**, and **policy validation exercises**.

---

### 🛡️ Prompt Examples:

1. 🛡️ Generate a DLP scenario involving an employee attempting to email confidential financial reports to their personal Gmail account.
2. 🛡️ Create a DLP policy testing scenario where a user uploads customer PII to an unauthorized cloud storage platform.
3. 🛡️ Simulate a DLP violation where sensitive design blueprints are copied to an unencrypted USB drive.
4. 🛡️ Write a scenario where DLP detects credit card numbers in a spreadsheet attached to an outbound email.
5. 🛡️ Generate a scenario where a marketing employee tries to share internal documents with an external vendor via Slack.
6. 🛡️ Create a DLP policy validation use case for detecting accidental internal emails with unmasked Social Security numbers.
7. 🛡️ Simulate insider data leakage via printing of confidential HR documents from a workstation.
8. 🛡️ Design a DLP use case where an executive shares sensitive M\&A details using a personal Dropbox account.
9. 🛡️ Write a scenario for testing endpoint DLP rules related to screenshots of classified information.
10. 🛡️ Generate a simulated incident involving bulk download of sensitive files prior to employee offboarding.
11. 🛡️ Create a scenario where DLP flags an attempt to post source code to GitHub from a corporate laptop.
12. 🛡️ Simulate a violation where internal pricing data is shared in plaintext via messaging apps like WhatsApp or Teams.
13. 🛡️ Draft a scenario where DLP prevents data exfiltration via use of base64-encoded attachments in outbound traffic.
14. 🛡️ Write a test scenario where a DLP agent must detect and block PII sent through HTTP form submissions.
15. 🛡️ Create a multi-step DLP alert simulation showing a user compressing sensitive files and transferring them over FTP.
16. 🛡️ Generate a risk-based scenario where a privileged user exfiltrates data using command-line utilities.
17. 🛡️ Simulate a cloud DLP scenario involving copying sensitive documents from Google Drive to a personal OneDrive account.
18. 🛡️ Write a training scenario where DLP alerts are generated by misconfigured OCR recognition of scanned legal contracts.
19. 🛡️ Generate a red team simulation prompt to test how DLP policies respond to data obfuscation techniques like hex encoding.
20. 🛡️ Create a post-incident analysis scenario of a successful DLP policy enforcement, including timeline and mitigation steps.
