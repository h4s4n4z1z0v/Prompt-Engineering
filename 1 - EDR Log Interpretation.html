<p><strong>“EDR Log Interpretation”</strong>, tailored for cybersecurity professionals using <strong>Generative AI</strong> to automate the interpretation, correlation, and summarization of <strong>Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR)</strong> logs. These prompts are applicable to tools like <strong>CrowdStrike Falcon</strong>, <strong>Microsoft Defender for Endpoint</strong>, <strong>SentinelOne</strong>, and <strong>Carbon Black</strong>.</p><p><br></p><p>1. “Analyze the EDR logs from endpoint WIN-332 and summarize any suspicious process activity, including parent-child relationships.”</p><p><br></p><p>2. “Review these EDR telemetry logs and identify signs of credential dumping, DLL injection, or process hollowing.”</p><p><br></p><p>3. “Interpret this sequence of endpoint events and determine if it aligns with MITRE ATT&amp;CK technique T1059 (Command and Scripting Interpreter).”</p><p><br></p><p>4. “Summarize behavioral anomalies observed in this EDR session, including lateral movement attempts or privilege escalation.”</p><p><br></p><p>5. “Correlate PowerShell executions in this EDR dataset with any known attacker TTPs or threat actor profiles.”</p><p><br></p><p>6. “Extract and summarize fileless malware activity from the following EDR telemetry collected over a 2-hour window.”</p><p><br></p><p>7. “Interpret the following EDR log entries and detect any indicators of ransomware behavior, including file renaming and mass encryption.”</p><p><br></p><p>8. “Analyze suspicious persistence mechanisms detected in this EDR data and provide containment recommendations.”</p><p><br></p><p>9. “Generate a forensic summary of this endpoint activity, focusing on abnormal registry modifications and system configurations.”</p><p><br></p><p>10. “Review process injection attempts from the EDR logs and suggest next steps for incident triage.”</p><p><br></p><p>11. “Given these raw EDR logs, identify any suspicious parent-child process trees indicative of LOLBins usage.”</p><p><br></p><p>12. “Summarize EDR alerts from a group of hosts and group them by similar attack patterns or exploited techniques.”</p><p><br></p><p>13. “Analyze endpoint behavior and determine if this is indicative of an initial access vector like phishing or removable media.”</p><p><br></p><p>14. “Extract all anomalous command-line executions from the provided logs and match them to potential ATT&amp;CK techniques.”</p><p><br></p><p>15. “Interpret Defender for Endpoint logs showing token impersonation activity and recommend mitigation.”</p><p><br></p><p>16. “Summarize evidence of potential rootkit installation attempts found in the following kernel-level EDR telemetry.”</p><p><br></p><p>17. “Analyze outbound network connections initiated from endpoints as seen in EDR logs and flag any beaconing behavior.”</p><p><br></p><p>18. “Generate a detection summary from EDR logs that identifies malware staging behavior or dropper activity.”</p><p><br></p><p>19. “Given a series of file access logs from EDR, determine if there is unauthorized access to sensitive or restricted directories.”</p><p><br></p><p>20. “Create a timeline of suspicious endpoint events from EDR logs, including timestamps, user activity, and impact scope.”</p><p><br></p>
