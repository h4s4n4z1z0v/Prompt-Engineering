<p><strong>“MITRE ATT&amp;CK Mapping and Overlay Creation”</strong>, designed for cybersecurity professionals using <strong>Generative AI</strong> to automatically map threats, incidents, and attack chains to the <strong>MITRE ATT&amp;CK framework</strong>, and to generate visual overlays for strategic threat analysis and simulation.</p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p>1. “Map the techniques used in this ransomware incident to MITRE ATT&amp;CK and generate a JSON overlay for Navigator.”</p><p><br></p><p>2. “Given this incident report, identify the MITRE ATT&amp;CK tactics and techniques involved and explain each one with its ID.”</p><p><br></p><p>3. “Create an ATT&amp;CK Navigator JSON file highlighting techniques from a phishing to lateral movement attack chain.”</p><p><br></p><p>4. “Generate a heat map overlay in MITRE ATT&amp;CK Navigator to show the most frequently used techniques in our environment based on the last 30 days of alerts.”</p><p><br></p><p>5. “Analyze this set of endpoint events and correlate them with MITRE ATT&amp;CK sub-techniques. Suggest visibility gaps.”</p><p><br></p><p>6. “Summarize an APT29 campaign using MITRE ATT&amp;CK mappings and provide a color-coded overlay indicating detection, response, and prevention coverage.”</p><p><br></p><p>7. “Based on the TTPs in this red team engagement report, generate a layer for MITRE ATT&amp;CK Navigator identifying all used techniques.”</p><p><br></p><p>8. “Review this threat intelligence feed and extract all referenced MITRE techniques and tactic stages for overlay generation.”</p><p><br></p><p>9. “Generate a MITRE ATT&amp;CK matrix focused on initial access and execution techniques relevant to cloud-based infrastructure.”</p><p><br></p><p>10. “Create a JSON layer for ATT&amp;CK Navigator showing the techniques exploited during this credential dumping scenario.”</p><p><br></p><p>11. “Identify MITRE ATT&amp;CK techniques missing from our SIEM detection rules based on this audit report and suggest queries to close the gaps.”</p><p><br></p><p>12. “Map these EDR-detected events to MITRE ATT&amp;CK and produce an overlay that color codes techniques by detection confidence.”</p><p><br></p><p>13. “Design an ATT&amp;CK matrix overlay for purple team exercises, highlighting techniques to simulate and monitor.”</p><p><br></p><p>14. “Analyze this data breach and generate a MITRE technique-to-defense mapping to identify where controls failed.”</p><p><br></p><p>15. “Generate a MITRE technique overlay grouped by tactic phase, showing which techniques were blocked, detected, or missed.”</p><p><br></p><p>16. “Based on the logs from this fileless malware attack, identify the MITRE ATT&amp;CK techniques and suggest mitigations per technique.”</p><p><br></p><p>17. “Create a multi-layered ATT&amp;CK overlay showing differences in attack techniques across finance, HR, and engineering departments.”</p><p><br></p><p>18. “Summarize the MITRE techniques targeted in the latest LockBit ransomware campaign and generate a visual matrix overlay.”</p><p><br></p><p>19. “Review the playbook for our recent red team operation and output an ATT&amp;CK Navigator JSON file mapping all used and simulated techniques.”</p><p><br></p><p>20. “From this SOC report, extract relevant MITRE ATT&amp;CK mappings and propose defensive coverage metrics per tactic (e.g., initial access, persistence, exfiltration).”</p>
