<p><strong>“SIEM Alert Summarization”</strong>—designed for cybersecurity professionals using <strong>Generative AI</strong> to analyze and synthesize alerts from SIEM platforms like <strong>Splunk</strong>, <strong>QRadar</strong>, <strong>Microsoft Sentinel</strong>, or <strong>Elastic</strong>.</p><p><br></p><p>1. “Summarize this SIEM alert involving multiple failed RDP login attempts. Include the source IP, targeted asset, and MITRE mapping if applicable.”</p><p><br></p><p>2. “Group these 15 alerts by attack technique and generate a high-level narrative for incident response triage.”</p><p><br></p><p>3. “Analyze the attached SIEM alert and create a concise summary for a Tier-1 analyst including potential false positive indicators.”</p><p><br></p><p>4. “Given the following correlated alerts, summarize the likely attack path and rate its severity on a 1–10 scale with justification.”</p><p><br></p><p>5. “Extract and summarize key fields from this JSON-formatted QRadar alert including rule name, source IP, and triggered conditions.”</p><p><br></p><p>6. “Review these Sentinel alerts and generate a SOC-ready summary that highlights actionable next steps.”</p><p><br></p><p>7. “Summarize the root cause and impact of this SIEM alert on anomalous Azure AD logins from unfamiliar locations.”</p><p><br></p><p>8. “Summarize this alert triggered by lateral movement detection across endpoints. Include hostname, timestamp, and relevant TTPs.”</p><p><br></p><p>9. “Create a daily digest of the top 10 critical alerts received in the past 24 hours and group them by attack stage.”</p><p><br></p><p>10. “Translate this verbose SIEM alert into an executive-level summary for the CISO with business impact considerations.”</p><p><br></p><p>11. “Summarize this false positive alert and explain why it should be excluded from future detection rules.”</p><p><br></p><p>12. “Review and summarize this multi-step alert involving phishing email, link click, credential use, and endpoint compromise.”</p><p><br></p><p>13. “Combine these multiple alerts into a single incident timeline using timestamps and asset identifiers.”</p><p><br></p><p>14. “Given these indicators from SIEM, generate a summary linking them to known threat actor behavior profiles.”</p><p><br></p><p>15. “Summarize this alert involving a suspicious service creation event and explain its threat relevance.”</p><p><br></p><p>16. “Create a 3-sentence summary of this high-volume DNS tunneling alert for internal reporting.”</p><p><br></p><p>17. “Break down this noisy alert into understandable sections, highlighting the components that triggered the rule logic.”</p><p><br></p><p>18. “Summarize the alert triggered by excessive file downloads to USB devices and recommend investigation steps.”</p><p><br></p><p>19. “Summarize this alert triggered by anomalous cloud storage API activity. Highlight indicators of exfiltration.”</p><p><br></p><p>20. “Summarize five SIEM alerts from different sources and classify each as high, medium, or low priority. Justify your reasoning.”</p>
