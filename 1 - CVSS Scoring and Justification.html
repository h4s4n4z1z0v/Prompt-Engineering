“CVSS Scoring and Justification”
Crafted for cybersecurity professionals using Generative AI to assign, explain, and validate Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) scores. These prompts help interpret vulnerabilities using CVSS v3.1 metrics, assess exploitability, and align scoring with business context.

Calculate the CVSS v3.1 base score for CVE-2023-23415 using the metrics provided, and explain each scoring vector.

Given this vulnerability description, assign a CVSS vector and explain how Attack Vector (AV), Attack Complexity (AC), and Privileges Required (PR) were determined.

Generate a detailed justification for scoring a privilege escalation vulnerability with a CVSS score of 7.8.

Compare the CVSS scores of two vulnerabilities affecting the same system and explain why one is considered more severe.

Analyze this vulnerability in an unauthenticated remote service and generate the full CVSS vector string with reasoning.

Explain the environmental metric scoring for a web vulnerability discovered in a high-criticality e-commerce application.

Generate a CVSS scoring rationale for a denial-of-service vulnerability that affects availability but not confidentiality or integrity.

Evaluate whether this vulnerability qualifies as ‘Low’, ‘Medium’, ‘High’, or ‘Critical’ under CVSS, based on provided exploit details.

Using CVSS v3.1, score a vulnerability in an IoT device that allows remote code execution with user interaction and limited privileges.

Generate a report comparing CVSS base, temporal, and environmental scores for CVE-2022-26134 (Atlassian Confluence RCE).

Summarize the impact of the Scope (S) metric in this CVSS vector and provide examples of scope change in real-world scenarios.

Write a training prompt explaining how to score vulnerabilities using CVSS v3.1 for SOC analysts new to vulnerability management.

Generate a vector and score for a vulnerability that requires local access, has a high integrity impact, and no availability impact.

Explain why a vulnerability with a low attack complexity can still have a high CVSS score if confidentiality and integrity impacts are high.

Based on this scan data, assign CVSS scores to each vulnerability and recommend which should be patched within 72 hours.

Create a justification template for reporting CVSS scoring to internal audit teams for quarterly vulnerability reviews.

Review these CVSS vectors and flag any inconsistencies between the stated attack complexity and required privileges.

Generate scoring logic and explanation for a cross-site scripting vulnerability on an internal-only application.

Explain the implications of scoring a vulnerability with a high availability impact in a healthcare setting under HIPAA.

Given a threat actor actively exploiting a CVE in the wild, adjust the temporal metrics and explain the scoring change.
