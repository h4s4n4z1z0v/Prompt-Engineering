<p><strong>“CVSS Scoring and Justification”</strong>, crafted specifically for cybersecurity professionals using <strong>Generative AI</strong> to assign, explain, and validate <strong>Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS)</strong> scores. These prompts help interpret vulnerabilities using CVSS v3.1 metrics, assess exploitability, and align scoring with business context.</p><p><br></p><p>1. “Calculate the CVSS v3.1 base score for CVE-2023-23415 using the metrics provided, and explain each scoring vector.”</p><p><br></p><p>2. “Given this vulnerability description, assign a CVSS vector and explain how Attack Vector (AV), Attack Complexity (AC), and Privileges Required (PR) were determined.”</p><p><br></p><p>3. “Generate a detailed justification for scoring a privilege escalation vulnerability with a CVSS score of 7.8.”</p><p><br></p><p>4. “Compare the CVSS scores of two vulnerabilities affecting the same system and explain why one is considered more severe.”</p><p><br></p><p>5. “Analyze this vulnerability in an unauthenticated remote service and generate the full CVSS vector string with reasoning.”</p><p><br></p><p>6. “Explain the environmental metric scoring for a web vulnerability discovered in a high-criticality e-commerce application.”</p><p><br></p><p>7. “Generate a CVSS scoring rationale for a denial-of-service vulnerability that affects availability but not confidentiality or integrity.”</p><p><br></p><p>8. “Evaluate whether this vulnerability qualifies as ‘Low’, ‘Medium’, ‘High’, or ‘Critical’ under CVSS, based on provided exploit details.”</p><p><br></p><p>9. “Using CVSS v3.1, score a vulnerability in an IoT device that allows remote code execution with user interaction and limited privileges.”</p><p><br></p><p>10. “Generate a report comparing CVSS base, temporal, and environmental scores for CVE-2022-26134 (Atlassian Confluence RCE).”</p><p><br></p><p>11. “Summarize the impact of the Scope (S) metric in this CVSS vector and provide examples of scope change in real-world scenarios.”</p><p><br></p><p>12. “Write a training prompt explaining how to score vulnerabilities using CVSS v3.1 for SOC analysts new to vulnerability management.”</p><p><br></p><p>13. “Generate a vector and score for a vulnerability that requires local access, has a high integrity impact, and no availability impact.”</p><p><br></p><p>14. “Explain why a vulnerability with a low attack complexity can still have a high CVSS score if confidentiality and integrity impacts are high.”</p><p><br></p><p>15. “Based on this scan data, assign CVSS scores to each vulnerability and recommend which should be patched within 72 hours.”</p><p><br></p><p>16. “Create a justification template for reporting CVSS scoring to internal audit teams for quarterly vulnerability reviews.”</p><p><br></p><p>17. “Review these CVSS vectors and flag any inconsistencies between the stated attack complexity and required privileges.”</p><p><br></p><p>18. “Generate scoring logic and explanation for a cross-site scripting vulnerability on an internal-only application.”</p><p><br></p><p>19. “Explain the implications of scoring a vulnerability with a high availability impact in a healthcare setting under HIPAA.”</p><p><br></p><p>20. “Given a threat actor actively exploiting a CVE in the wild, adjust the temporal metrics and explain the scoring change.”</p>
