## 🔐 DevSecOps Automation Use Cases

Tailored for security engineers, DevOps architects, CI/CD pipeline owners, and compliance teams leveraging **Generative AI** to enable **security-as-code, automated policy enforcement, and secure software delivery** across DevSecOps environments.

---

### 🔐 Prompt Examples:

1. 🔐 Generate an automation use case where code is scanned for secrets and API keys before being merged into the main branch.
2. 🔐 Create a CI/CD pipeline integration that triggers SAST and DAST scans automatically on each pull request.
3. 🔐 Write a use case for automating dependency vulnerability checks using tools like Snyk or OWASP Dependency-Check.
4. 🔐 Generate a prompt to document automated compliance checks against CIS Benchmarks for containerized workloads.
5. 🔐 Create an automation flow that blocks deployment if container images do not pass security policies defined in OPA or Kyverno.
6. 🔐 Write a GenAI-assisted use case where cloud misconfigurations are identified and auto-remediated via Terraform scripts.
7. 🔐 Generate a Jenkins pipeline extension that runs infrastructure-as-code (IaC) scans before provisioning cloud resources.
8. 🔐 Create a use case for integrating GitHub Actions with security gates for code signing and artifact integrity.
9. 🔐 Write an automation workflow for rotating secrets and credentials in GitLab CI/CD pipelines using HashiCorp Vault.
10. 🔐 Generate a use case where policy-as-code is enforced through automated PR reviews in Git repositories.
11. 🔐 Create an alerting workflow where security issues in Dockerfiles are flagged via Slack or Teams notifications.
12. 🔐 Write a prompt for auto-generating security baselines for Kubernetes workloads using automated CIS scans.
13. 🔐 Generate a use case that automatically tags and quarantines non-compliant infrastructure during CI/CD builds.
14. 🔐 Create a use case where a GenAI agent summarizes IaC scan results and provides pull request comments with mitigation advice.
15. 🔐 Write a scenario where automated SBOM (Software Bill of Materials) generation is enforced as part of the pipeline.
16. 🔐 Generate a use case to enforce secure coding practices via auto-linting and AI-assisted code suggestions.
17. 🔐 Create a DevSecOps flow that integrates threat modeling and abuse case generation during agile sprint planning.
18. 🔐 Write a prompt to simulate pre-deployment risk scoring of applications using combined code and cloud posture analysis.
19. 🔐 Generate an end-to-end DevSecOps dashboard that tracks security gates, failed policies, and remediation SLAs.
20. 🔐 Create a blueprint for integrating GenAI with GitOps to enforce security guardrails during continuous delivery.
