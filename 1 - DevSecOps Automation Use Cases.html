<p><strong>“DevSecOps Automation Use Cases”</strong>, tailored for security engineers, DevOps architects, CI/CD pipeline owners, and compliance teams using <strong>Generative AI</strong> to enable <strong>security-as-code, automated policy enforcement, and secure software delivery</strong> across DevSecOps environments.</p><p><br></p><p>1. “Generate an automation use case where code is scanned for secrets and API keys before being merged into the main branch.”</p><p><br></p><p>2. “Create a CI/CD pipeline integration that triggers SAST and DAST scans automatically on each pull request.”</p><p><br></p><p>3. “Write a use case for automating dependency vulnerability checks using tools like Snyk or OWASP Dependency-Check.”</p><p><br></p><p>4. “Generate a prompt to document automated compliance checks against CIS Benchmarks for containerized workloads.”</p><p><br></p><p>5. “Create an automation flow that blocks deployment if container images do not pass security policies defined in OPA or Kyverno.”</p><p><br></p><p>6. “Write a GenAI-assisted use case where cloud misconfigurations are identified and auto-remediated via Terraform scripts.”</p><p><br></p><p>7. “Generate a Jenkins pipeline extension that runs infrastructure-as-code (IaC) scans before provisioning cloud resources.”</p><p><br></p><p>8. “Create a use case for integrating GitHub Actions with security gates for code signing and artifact integrity.”</p><p><br></p><p>9. “Write an automation workflow for rotating secrets and credentials in GitLab CI/CD pipelines using HashiCorp Vault.”</p><p><br></p><p>10. “Generate a use case where policy-as-code is enforced through automated PR reviews in Git repositories.”</p><p><br></p><p>11. “Create an alerting workflow where security issues in Dockerfiles are flagged via Slack or Teams notifications.”</p><p><br></p><p>12. “Write a prompt for auto-generating security baselines for Kubernetes workloads using automated CIS scans.”</p><p><br></p><p>13. “Generate a use case that automatically tags and quarantines non-compliant infrastructure during CI/CD builds.”</p><p><br></p><p>14. “Create a use case where a GenAI agent summarizes IaC scan results and provides pull request comments with mitigation advice.”</p><p><br></p><p>15. “Write a scenario where automated SBOM (Software Bill of Materials) generation is enforced as part of the pipeline.”</p><p><br></p><p>16. “Generate a use case to enforce secure coding practices via auto-linting and AI-assisted code suggestions.”</p><p><br></p><p>17. “Create a DevSecOps flow that integrates threat modeling and abuse case generation during agile sprint planning.”</p><p><br></p><p>18. “Write a prompt to simulate pre-deployment risk scoring of applications using combined code and cloud posture analysis.”</p><p><br></p><p>19. “Generate an end-to-end DevSecOps dashboard that tracks security gates, failed policies, and remediation SLAs.”</p><p><br></p><p>20. “Create a blueprint for integrating GenAI with GitOps to enforce security guardrails during continuous delivery.”</p>
