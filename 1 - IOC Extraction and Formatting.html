<p><strong>“IOC Extraction and Formatting”</strong>, designed for cybersecurity professionals using <strong>Generative AI</strong> to <strong>extract, classify, format, and normalize Indicators of Compromise (IOCs)</strong> from logs, reports, alerts, and threat intelligence documents. These prompts support the creation of structured IOC feeds that can be integrated into SIEMs, TIPs, and EDR platforms.</p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p>1. “Extract all IP addresses, domain names, file hashes, and email addresses from this incident report and organize them into a structured IOC table.”</p><p><br></p><p>2. “Parse this EDR alert and extract all relevant IOCs including processes, registry keys, and dropped file names.”</p><p><br></p><p>3. “From this threat intel PDF, extract indicators and classify them as IP, domain, URL, hash, or file path.”</p><p><br></p><p>4. “Summarize all IOCs from this SIEM log sample and present them in STIX/TAXII-compatible JSON format.”</p><p><br></p><p>5. “Given this email header and body, extract phishing-related IOCs and categorize them by IOC type and risk level.”</p><p><br></p><p>6. “Generate a CSV file from this text dump containing IOCs with columns for Type, Value, Source, and Confidence Score.”</p><p><br></p><p>7. “Convert these unstructured IOCs into a standardized MISP format with appropriate tags and timestamps.”</p><p><br></p><p>8. “Extract all file hashes and their associated filenames from these sandbox execution logs and normalize them using SHA-256 format.”</p><p><br></p><p>9. “From this web proxy log, extract malicious URLs and group them by destination domain and path.”</p><p><br></p><p>10. “Identify all IOCs from this JSON alert feed and remove duplicates before exporting into IOC feed format.”</p><p><br></p><p>11. “Extract and format IOCs from a Slack conversation related to a suspected breach. Include time of mention and user role if possible.”</p><p><br></p><p>12. “Summarize the IOCs from this endpoint alert and present them in a table with MITRE ATT&amp;CK mappings.”</p><p><br></p><p>13. “Normalize the extracted IOCs into Splunk lookup file format and include source confidence ratings.”</p><p><br></p><p>14. “Create a YAML block with formatted IOCs for ingestion into Palo Alto Cortex XSOAR.”</p><p><br></p><p>15. “Given this threat actor dossier, extract all historically used IOCs and organize them chronologically.”</p><p><br></p><p>16. “Generate a markdown IOC summary from this MISP threat feed update for analyst briefings.”</p><p><br></p><p>17. “Format these indicators for integration into Suricata IDS rule sets, including correct syntax for domains and IPs.”</p><p><br></p><p>18. “Extract IOCs from these log files, tag them with detection context (e.g., lateral movement, exfiltration), and export to CSV.”</p><p><br></p><p>19. “Build a table that separates active vs. historical IOCs based on this threat campaign report.”</p><p><br></p><p>20. “Review these virus scan reports and extract suspicious filenames and registry entries. Format the output for use in EDR IOC enrichment.”</p><p><br></p>
