<p><strong>“Firewall Rule Optimization Prompts”</strong>, created for network security engineers, SOC analysts, and compliance teams using <strong>Generative AI</strong> to review, streamline, and validate <strong>firewall rule sets</strong> across on-premise and cloud environments. These prompts help in reducing risk, enhancing performance, and aligning with security policies.</p><p><br></p><p>1. “Analyze this firewall rule set and identify unused or shadowed rules that can be safely removed.”</p><p><br></p><p>2. “Generate a report summarizing overly permissive firewall rules that violate least privilege principles.”</p><p><br></p><p>3. “Write a prompt to suggest segmentation improvements based on current firewall rules between internal subnets.”</p><p><br></p><p>4. “Summarize risky ‘any-any’ firewall rules and recommend granular replacements based on traffic analysis.”</p><p><br></p><p>5. “Create a cleanup plan for a legacy firewall configuration with redundant rules and deprecated IP ranges.”</p><p><br></p><p>6. “Generate optimized firewall rules for a DMZ hosting web, app, and database servers, ensuring layered access control.”</p><p><br></p><p>7. “Review this rule allowing SSH from all IPs and recommend a secure alternative using jump hosts and whitelisting.”</p><p><br></p><p>8. “Simulate a misconfiguration scenario where duplicate NAT rules interfere with application routing.”</p><p><br></p><p>9. “Analyze firewall logs and generate rule suggestions to block repeated port scanning attempts from external sources.”</p><p><br></p><p>10. “Generate a checklist for quarterly firewall rule audits including policy review, hit count analysis, and compliance mapping.”</p><p><br></p><p>11. “Write a prompt to verify whether current outbound firewall rules prevent data exfiltration over non-standard ports.”</p><p><br></p><p>12. “Design rule logic for segmenting access between finance and R&amp;D departments while allowing IT monitoring.”</p><p><br></p><p>13. “Review a flat network firewall rule base and generate a micro-segmentation enforcement strategy.”</p><p><br></p><p>14. “Create a matrix of firewall rules and map each one to associated business applications and owners.”</p><p><br></p><p>15. “Generate a compliance-focused review of firewall rules in relation to PCI DSS Requirement 1.”</p><p><br></p><p>16. “Simulate a rule conflict scenario in a next-gen firewall and provide a resolution strategy to avoid application outages.”</p><p><br></p><p>17. “Create a policy-based firewall ruleset for a cloud-native environment using tags and identity-based access.”</p><p><br></p><p>18. “Generate a prompt to monitor expired rule exceptions and alert stakeholders for renewal or removal.”</p><p><br></p><p>19. “Write a prompt to summarize all rules that allow unrestricted outbound internet access and recommend remediation.”</p><p><br></p><p>20. “Design a firewall rule optimization playbook with steps for rule ranking, consolidation, and exception tracking.”</p>
