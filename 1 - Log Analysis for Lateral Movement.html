<p><strong>“Log Analysis for Lateral Movement”</strong>, designed for SOC analysts, threat hunters, and incident responders using <strong>Generative AI</strong> to detect, summarize, and document signs of <strong>lateral movement</strong> across enterprise environments using EDR, SIEM, and authentication logs.</p><p><br></p><p>1. “Analyze Windows Event Logs to identify signs of lateral movement through RDP logins between internal hosts.”</p><p><br></p><p>2. “Summarize this set of authentication logs to detect pass-the-hash activity across domain controllers.”</p><p><br></p><p>3. “Generate an analysis report of SMB connection logs showing anomalous use of administrative shares from non-IT users.”</p><p><br></p><p>4. “Correlate these Kerberos ticket logs to highlight potential overpass-the-hash or Golden Ticket attacks.”</p><p><br></p><p>5. “Create a timeline of lateral movement by mapping host-to-host access using workstation logon events (Event ID 4624).”</p><p><br></p><p>6. “Summarize PowerShell logs and Sysmon data to identify remote execution attempts using Invoke-Command or PsExec.”</p><p><br></p><p>7. “Analyze failed and successful logon attempts across multiple endpoints and identify patterns indicating credential reuse.”</p><p><br></p><p>8. “Generate a summary report showing pivot activity across VLANs using VPN or internal proxy logs.”</p><p><br></p><p>9. “Simulate a scenario where lateral movement occurs using WMI-based remote command execution between servers.”</p><p><br></p><p>10. “Summarize unusual parent-child process relationships across endpoints that may indicate remote payload deployment.”</p><p><br></p><p>11. “Write a detection analysis highlighting lateral movement using Scheduled Tasks created remotely via RPC.”</p><p><br></p><p>12. “Analyze Windows Firewall logs to find lateral traffic originating from low-privilege endpoints accessing high-value assets.”</p><p><br></p><p>13. “Generate a detection narrative involving the use of stolen credentials for lateral access via interactive logons.”</p><p><br></p><p>14. “Summarize Sysmon Event ID 3 (Network Connections) logs to track lateral movement paths between hosts.”</p><p><br></p><p>15. “Write a prompt to analyze endpoint telemetry and identify use of native Windows tools like net.exe and at.exe for remote tasking.”</p><p><br></p><p>16. “Simulate detection of lateral movement where registry modifications enable remote service creation.”</p><p><br></p><p>17. “Summarize how this alert set indicates potential lateral movement in a hybrid cloud environment using on-prem to cloud pivoting.”</p><p><br></p><p>18. “Generate a heat map of internal host access frequency and flag unusual increases in inter-host activity.”</p><p><br></p><p>19. “Correlate SIEM alert logs with EDR telemetry to reconstruct lateral movement after phishing-induced compromise.”</p><p><br></p><p>20. “Create a detection-focused summary of lateral movement involving AD enumeration, remote service creation, and credential theft.”</p>
